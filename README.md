# Introduction
Lantern is a script that sets your desktop wallpaper depending on the 
selected champion/skin in league. This is inspired by [LeagueWallpaper](https://github.com/Renzix/leaguewallpaper).
Lantern has a few advantages over LeagueWallpaper:
- The splash arts are downloaded automatically
- Works with skins
- There is no config file
- It uses [LCU api](https://riot-api-libraries.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lcu.html)

# Installation
- Get the latest python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/)
- Download the source code, unzip if needed 
- cd into source code directory
- run `pip install .`

# Running
After the installation, the `lantern` script will be avalabile in your `PATH`.
If you want a shortcut on desktop or to run it at startup, move the `startlantern.bat` file to desktop or [autostart folder](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/add-an-app-to-run-automatically-at-startup-in-windows-10-150da165-dcd9-7230-517b-cf3c295d89dd).
